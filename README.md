Welcome to Mystic ACO. This is a in-depth guide on how the server works.

## Overview
- At Mystic ACO, our goal is simple: to help you secure the most limited and hyped itemsâ€”stress-free.
  
- When you sign up for our Auto-Checkout (ACO) service, youâ€™re letting us handle the heavy lifting on drop day. Just sit back and relaxâ€”we only charge you if we successfully secure the item for you. No success, no fee.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Visit the Auto Checkout Section
Head over to our ACO section where youâ€™ll find forms for all upcoming releases.
Choose Your Drop
Find the form for the release youâ€™re interested in and click the linkâ€”itâ€™ll take you to a Google Form. Fill in your info carefully and double-check everything before submitting. Once submitted, no edits or cancellations are allowed.

We Take It From There
On drop day, weâ€™ll run your details through our bots to secure your item.

Success = Payment
If your slot hits, you'll receive a confirmation email and have 48 hours to complete your Pay After Success (PAS) payment.
